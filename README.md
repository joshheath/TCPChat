# TCPChat

A Ruby chat app using the Ruby standard library Socket. Server receives client connections and stores them in data dictionaries. The dictionaries keep track of what room the client is located in, receive messages, and relay the messages to other users. Change 'localhost' to the IP address of the server host to operate. 

## Getting started
